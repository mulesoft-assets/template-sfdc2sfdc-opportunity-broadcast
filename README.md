# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to syncronize accounts between two Salesfoce orgs.

This Kick (template) should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts from one SalesForce instance to another. Everytime there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in SalesForce source instance and it will be responsible for updating the account on the target org.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Kick leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
The integration is triggered by a poll defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying newest SalesForce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job.
During the Process stage, each SFDC User will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching user in the SFDC Org B.
The last step of the Process stage will group the users and create/update them in SFDC Org B.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Kick will logoutput statistics data into the console.

# Run it!

Simple steps to get SFDC to SFDC Accounts Sync running.

## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>

While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time a account is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronised to SFDC Org B as long as it has an Email.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. The application will poll SalesForce to know if there are any newly created or updated objects and synchronice them.

## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

In order to use this Mule Kick you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:

### Application configuration
+ http.port `9090` 
+ poll.frequencyMillis `60000`
+ poll.startDelayMillis `0`
+ watermark.defaultExpression `YESTERDAY`

#### SalesForce Connector configuration for company A
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/28.0`

#### SalesForce Connector configuration for company B
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/28.0`

# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>

This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Kick is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Kick.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [inboundEndpoints.xml](#inboundendpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the kick is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will poll for SalesForce creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Kick:

1. During the Input stage the Kick will go to the SalesForce Org A and query all the existing users that match the filter criteria.
2. During the Process stage, each SFDC User will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching user in the SFDC Org B.
3. The last step of the Process stage will group the users and create/update them in SFDC Org B.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Kick will logoutput statistics data into the console.

## inboundEndpoints.xml<a name="inboundendpointsxml"/>
This is file is not used in this particular kick, but you'll oftenly find flows containing the inbound endpoints to start the integration.

## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
Contains a [Catch Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Catch+Exception+Strategy) that is only Logging the exception thrown (If so). As you imagine, this is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions.

# Testing the Kick <a name="testingthekick"/>

You will notice that the Kick has been shipped with test.
These devidi them self into two categories:

+ Unit Tests
+ Integration Tests

You can run any of them by just doing right click on the class and clicking on run as Junit test.

Do bear in mind that you'll have to tell the test classes which property file to use.
For you convinience we have added a file mule.test.properties located in "src/test/resources".
In the run configurations of the test just make sure to add the following property:

+ -Dmule.env=test
